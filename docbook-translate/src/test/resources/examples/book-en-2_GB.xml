  <para>For any social group to be sustainable, it must focus its attention on the formation of its leadership as well as its members. The same is true of the church. This need for leadership development is particularly acute whenever the church experiences significant quantitative growth, in order to prevent the church from drifting away from its central mission and values. As Philip Jenkins, Andrew Walls and Lamin Sanneh have shown, the center of evangelicalism, indeed of the church as a whole, has shifted from the West to the global South and East. It is in the “Majority World” that the greatest growth as well as the greatest risks are taking place. The evangelical theological school plays a central role in the growth and sustainability of the church. If the mission of the church is to reach and to serve the world, the mission of the theological training institutions is to serve the church by training leadership for her mission – the theological school is not an end in itself, but a missional instrument in the hands of the church.  </para>
  <para role="indent">At the very heart of this role of the school is the activity of the head of the institution (president, principal) and the chief academic officer (CAO – dean, director of studies, etc.). While the institutional head leads the institution overall and takes the vital decision concerning the achievement of the school’s mission and vision, he or she works in vital tandem with the CAO so that the latter can “lead from the center,” to paraphrase the title of a book by Jeanne McLean. This center is the intersection where chief executive, faculty, students, board, and stakeholders meet and work together in the learning community. Despite the clear importance of these roles, chief executives and chief academic officers of theological schools are often thrust into this job without professional training. The CAOs often find themselves in this post because: (a) they are organized; (b) they are available; (c) they get along with others in the institution. However, they so often find themselves ill-equipped for the task that is before them, with few resources, with little support for a role that is often misunderstood by their peers. It is no wonder that their “shelf life” in this post is often relatively short. Their work and their calling puts themselves at the nerve center of the institution, yet their lack of professional preparation and support can frustrate them and weaken the institution as a whole, and thus the fulfillment of its calling. These dedicated men and women do not deserve such a fate. This volume, and the ones that will follow, God willing, intend to equip and resource chief executives and chief academic officers in evangelical theological institutions for greater satisfaction and fulfillment. We believe that this will result, not only in the well-being and longevity of the academic officers, but also in the effectiveness of the institution itself in realizing its mission and calling in behalf of church, in collaboration and synergy with neighboring sister institutions, and, ultimately, for the sake of the church and the <emphasis>missio Dei</emphasis>. This is our intent and our prayer for the present book and its future companion volumes.  </para>

  <para>The ICETE Programme for Academic Leadership (IPAL) has developed since 2005 when the first seminar for academic leadership was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand. Since then, many training sessions for capacity building have been arranged in different parts of the world. The project of this book on the Foundations for Academic Leadership emerged during the seminars. Many participants expressed the need for a textbook that provides helpful insights into the ministry of academic leadership. As editors we trust that the various contributions will provide helpful insights to academic leaders which they can implement in theological education.  </para>
  <para role="indent">This is a project of the International Council for Evangelical Theological Education (ICETE).

    <title>Introduction</title>
  </info>
  <para>Academic leaders play an essential role in the accomplishment of the mission and vision of academic institutions. They have often been called to serve at level where they are expected to carry out responsibilities that they have not been trained to perform. Without distinction of location or type of educational institutions, it is a fact that most of those who are appointed in leadership positions lack the specific training for effective leadership. In order to assist them in their positions, a substantial number of books addressing issues of Academic Administration and Leadership and related areas are published every year, mainly in the North American context. However, as we travel to other regions of the globe to offer Seminars for Academic Leaders supported by the ICETE Programme for Academic Leadership (IPAL) we have been confronted with the need for written resources that will provide academic leaders in those regions with the insights needed for the day-to-day challenges in their search for quality and excellence. </para>
  <para role="indent">This book is the first of the Academic Leadership Series, which was conceived at the same time that the ICETE Programme for Academic Leadership (IPAL) was officially established in September, 2010, at the ICETE Executive Board meeting in Medellin, Colombia. At that time, Fritz was appointed to serve as the Programme Coordinator. Among its other responsibilities, the IPAL is committed to provide training to academic leaders in theological schools related to the eight regional ICETE-Accrediting Agencies, as well as publish the materials used in this training. After a number of conversations with ICETE Executive Board members during the Triennial Continental Conference of AETAL (Association of Evangelical Theological Education in Latin America), that followed the board meeting in Medellin, Colombia, I (Orbelina) was invited to join their project, serving together with Fritz as an editor of the series.  </para>
  <para role="indent">Thus, the purpose of this project is to provide quality written resources for use in the ICETE Programme for Academic Leadership (IPAL) seminars held around the world. This initial series consists of three textbooks: </para>

  <para>This book on Foundations for Academic Leadership is not intended to be a comprehensive text on academic leadership. Rather, our purpose is to present essential aspects that academic leaders in theological institutions and seminaries need to be aware of. As a result, we have structured it into four main sections in which different authors have contributed with topics that represent their areas of expertise as well as their understanding of the hard work that academic leaders exercise on behalf of their institutions.  </para>
  <para role="indent">Part I addresses the Foundations for Theological Education. The first chapter establishes the biblical foundations for theological education from three perspectives including the well-being of the people of God, the advancement of the mission of God, and the preservation of the integrity of the Christian faith. It concludes that theological learning is a necessary element in the unfolding of the divine purpose. The second chapter provides guidelines for the development of an operational philosophy of theological education, which the author proposes as a practical way to move from philosophy to strategy. In chapter 3, the author proposes that every theological institution needs a promised land and that every institution needs a Moses to take them there. The way to move from vision to reality requires well defined vision, mission, and values in order to shape objectives in theological education. Chapter 4 discusses factors that contribute to providing the Christian community and the broader society with graduates that can faithfully demonstrate the quality of their theological education through the excellence of their own thinking and ministry. The author emphasizes that “the most important factor of all is that the educational community is a learning community, committed to not only do things well, but to constantly do them better.”  </para>
  <para role="indent">Part II addresses the characteristics and responsibilities of academic leadership. In chapters 5 and 6, the author provides insights gained through serving as an academic dean of a theological seminary in Bangkok for many years. Chapter 5 addresses the relationship between the president and the academic dean serving as partners in theological education. The aspects discussed in the chapter assume an organizational structure in which the dean reports and works directly with the president of the institution. The next chapter focuses on the academic deanship as a ministry and the challenges that the position and functions of the dean pose. </para>
  <para role="indent">Part III focuses on some of the crucial practices required in academic administration. Chapter 7 provides an explanation of what strategic planning is by contrasting it with what strategic planning is not. The author also provides detailed guidelines to develop a strategic plan and some considerations for its implementation taking into account the different levels of the institution’s leadership as well as its faculty. Chapter 8 discusses the accreditation process. Based on his experience in accreditation in the European context, the author helps to understand what accreditation is about as well as some common misconceptions that academic leaders might have. He also addresses the extensive work that accreditation requires. Chapter 9 addresses a critical topic that is closely related to accreditation, which is the process of institutional assessment. Based on his experience in the accreditation of higher education in North America, the author provides practical insights on the what, why and how of assessment, making the readers aware that “assessment is pointless unless it yields improvement.”  </para>
  <para role="indent">Part IV is composed of three chapters that address different practices that are inherent to effective leadership. Chapter 10 focuses on the academic leaders as agents of change. It highlights aspects of organizational change that will help academic leaders have a better understanding of what change is about. It also discusses how the environment that surrounds the institution as well as the internal environment and culture of the institution influence change. Characteristics of change agents and some recommendations for academic leaders are also included in the discussion. Chapter 11 addresses conflict and the biblical perspective of conflict management. The author provides a practical method for conflict resolution. Finally, chapter 12 is a reflection in which the author delves into his own experience to share what he considers to be the characteristics and competencies needed to effective leadership. </para>
  <para role="indent">It is our hope that academic leaders serving in educational institutions will benefit with the reading of each chapter and the reflection and action point sections that follow. These have been designed to help the readers consider how the issues discussed by the authors reflect on their own practices as leaders. We would like to conclude this introduction with the words of Gordon T. Smith, President of Ambrose University College and Seminary and Professor of Systematic Theology: </para>
  <blockquote>
    <para>Good administrative leaders care about people! And they care about good scholarship. And they care about teaching and learning. But their work is inherently institutional; their academic discipline, one might say, is the college or university. Their mental and emotional energy – critical thinking, creativity, problem solving, nuanced and complex understanding – is focused on the phenomenon of the institution.<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002541"><para>.

  <para>For some time now, theological education has been the object of much criticism. Discontent has been voiced on just about every aspect of the embattled enterprise. Some have drawn attention to what they consider its disjointed character.<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002543"><para>. See Edward Farley, <emphasis>Theologia: The Fragmentation and Unity of Theological Education</emphasis> (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress, 1983).</para></footnote> Others have chided it for its lopsided focus on the head and its consequent neglect of the heart and the hand.<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002544"><para>. See R. Albert Mohler, Jr. and D. G. Hart, eds., <emphasis>Theological Education in the Evangelical Tradition </emphasis>(Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1996), 12, where this is identified as a major factor in the ambivalence and discomfort that evangelicalism feels vis-á-vis theological learning.</para></footnote> Still others have berated its resistance to change and its obliviousness to new mindsets, contextual realities, and contemporary needs.<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002546"><para>. See Manfred W. Kohl and A. N. Lal Senanayake, eds., <emphasis>Educating for Tomorrow: Theological Leadership for the Asian Context</emphasis> (Bangalore, India: SAIACS Press and Overseas Council International, 2002); especially chapter 1 and 2.</para></footnote> In the non-Western world, complaints have been expressed about its captivity to the Western <emphasis>modus operandi</emphasis>.<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002547"><para>. Kosuke Koyama, “Theological Education: Its Unities and Diversities,” paper presented at the Association of Theological Schools and Conference, Pittsburgh, PA, June 15–16, 1992, 10.</para></footnote> </para>
  <para role="indent">These strictures have given rise to questions about the very worthwhileness of the venture. In their introduction to a collection of essays which focus on evangelical theological education specifically, R. Albert Mohler Jr. and D. G. Hart state that despite the role that theological education has played in the growth and vitality of evangelicalism over the centuries, its importance to that tradition “has often been slighted, if not ignored . . .”<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002548"><para>. Mohler and Hart<emphasis>, Theological Education in the Evangelical Tradition</emphasis>, 12.</para></footnote> A recent critic has put the broadside even more starkly: “Seminary education in general,” she charges, “has only four things wrong with it: it is taught by the wrong people in the wrong place with the wrong curriculum and has the wrong oversight.”<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002549"><para>. Kohl and Senanayake, <emphasis>Educating for Tomorrow</emphasis>, 31.</para></footnote> </para>
  <para role="indent">While strong and biting, this avalanche of criticism does not represent the sum total of opinions about the enterprise, however. Alongside the broadside, there is a line of thought which is more favorable to the effort, even though it, too, acknowledges its various challenges. In this strand, one detects not only an affirmation of the usefulness of theological learning, but even a mild apologetic and a cautious optimism about its future.<footnote xml:id="ftnt-0000254b"><para>. See International Council for Evangelical Theological Education, <emphasis>Manifesto for the Renewal of Theological Education</emphasis>, 1983, 1991; Robert Banks, <emphasis>Reenvisioning Theological Education: Exploring a Missional Alternative to Current Models</emphasis> (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1999); Daniel O. Aleshire, <emphasis>Earthen Vessels: Hopeful Reflections on the Work and Future of Theological Schools</emphasis> (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2008).</para></footnote> At this juncture, it seems appropriate to ask what insight Scripture might contribute to this conversation. In his exposition on the nature of revelation, Geerhardus Vos has said that God’s self-disclosure has been given in response to the practical “needs of his people in the course of history.”<footnote xml:id="ftnt-0000254c"><para>. Geerhardus Vos, <emphasis>Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments </emphasis>(Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1948, 1985), 9.</para></footnote> If theological education is of any importance to the <emphasis>bene esse</emphasis> of the people of God, it is not farfetched to expect to find in God’s revelation indications to this effect. Indeed, the thesis of this chapter is that Scripture not only corroborates the usefulness of theological learning, but within its ambit, there is sufficient datum for the mounting of a robust apologetic for the very necessity of the enterprise.  </para>
  <para role="indent">At the heart of our argumentation is the contention that, biblically speaking, such learning constitutes an essential accompaniment to the unfolding of God’s plan and economy. I will endeavor to make the case for this claim by spelling out the importance of theological learning for three elements of the divine purpose: the well-being of the people of God, the advancement of the mission of God, and the preservation of Christian faith. </para>

      <title>Theological Education and the Well-Being of the People of God</title>
    </info>
    <para>It is a biblically grounded truth that humanity’s well-being is one of God’s dominant concerns. The Bible opens and closes with the same happy scene: humanity enjoying bliss in the presence of God (Gen 1:26–31; Rev 21:1–4; 22:1–6). According to God’s plan, the primal blessedness that began and was lost in Eden will be recovered in the eternal city God at the consummation of his redemptive plan. But until then, God’s agenda for his people’s wellness continues and the Bible places theological education at the heart of the implementation of that agenda. This should be abundantly clear when we consider the role that theological education plays in the care, security, and renewal of God’s people. An examination of Scripture reveals that the delivery of these “goods” necessitates considerable theological training. Let’s consider each in turn. </para>

        <title>Care through Conscientious Shepherding</title>
      </info>
      <para>Care is essential to the well-being of everything. Care is the required attention paid to a thing in order to promote its growth, maintain its condition, and ensure its continued flourishing. In the Bible, the importance of care for the wellness of the people of God is considered so high that its provision is entrusted to those who were known to be the experts in the trade: shepherds! In Psalm 23, David describes Yahweh himself as shepherd – his shepherd (v. 1). In the New Testament, the designation is copiously applied to Jesus, who called himself the “good shepherd” (John 10:11). As in the case of Yahweh, Jesus’ role as shepherd relates specifically to his people (John 10:14; Heb 13:20). The act of shepherding is exercised for the benefit of a needy flock. According to Jesus, shepherdless flocks are vulnerable and exposed to danger because they are bereft of care (Matt 9:36; cf. Ezek 34).  </para>
      <para role="indent">Jesus’ acute awareness of people’s need for pastoral care explains the significance of Jesus’ call and grooming of Peter for this task for the benefit of his church. John 21:15–17 is the <emphasis>locus classicus</emphasis> for the Petrine commission. Earlier on, Jesus had said that Peter would play the lead role in the emergence of – the Messianic community (Matt 16:17–20). Now that the time for the fulfillment of that promise was drawing near, Jesus deemed it necessary to renew his commission to Peter. It is evident that in this act of recommissioning Jesus’ concern was patently pastoral. This is clear from his threefold charge to Peter to: “feed my sheep” (v. 15); “take care of my sheep” (v. 16); and “feed my sheep” (v. 18). The primary task entrusted to Peter, therefore, calls for the provision of proper nurture and appropriate guidance to a flock that could not provide it for itself.  </para>
      <para role="indent">As far as Jesus was concerned, this need for care was pressing and the task of shepherding was serious. First, the ingathering of the flock was impending (John 21:1–14). If that harvest was not to be spoilt, the task of shepherding had to begin in earnest. Those who were about to be brought together urgently needed to be fed and tended.<footnote xml:id="ftnt-00002550"><para>. Ibid.</para></footnote> Second, such nurture had to be provided with all seriousness since the recipients of the mandated care were people who were special to Jesus: He called them “<emphasis>my</emphasis> lambs” and “<emphasis>my</emphasis> sheep.” Third, the function of shepherding is a noble one since it is the continuation of what Jesus himself was carrying out on behalf of the flock.  </para>
      <para role="indent">But how is one prepared to play this lofty role? The case of Peter shows clearly that the responsibility of shepherd is not entrusted to all and sundry regardless of their readiness for it. <emphasis>The function of shepherding is a calling that requires a preparation that befits its nature</emphasis>. The gospels show that before Peter could be entrusted with that office he had to go through quite a demanding training program. Three distinct levels of his preparation for this ministry come to the surface. First, as the leading member of the Twelve, Peter was part of Jesus’ closely knit community, and in that capacity, was thoroughly immersed in the training regime that Jesus designed for that group. From the gospels we learn that that program was sustained, ongoing, intensive, and extensive. It not only required the disciples to wrestle with tough issues and examine difficult questions, it also brought them face to face with challenging situations, and plunged them into emotionally intense experiences.  </para>
      <para role="indent">Second, as a member of the group of three, Peter was part of Jesus’ inner circle (Mark 9:2). In this capacity, he was exposed to things that the rest of the disciples did not have the opportunity to see. One thinks, for instance, of the transfiguration event where Jesus gave to the privileged trio a rare glance at his spectacular glory (Matt 17:1–11). That event made such an impression on Peter that he would later use the experience to bolster the authoritative nature of his own teaching (2 Pet 1:12–18). </para>
      <para role="indent">Third, Peter’s temperament and personality gave to his learning experience an edge that was unique. Inquisitive, he often elicits an elaboration on the issues that seem to have not been part of Jesus’ original lesson plan (John 13:6–10). Outspoken, he was prone to blunders; but Jesus invariably used these as opportunities for correction, rebuke, and even the exercise of pastoral ministry toward a naive and impressionable learner (Matt 16:22–23; John 13:8, 36–40; Matt 26:40). Impulsive, he got himself into learning situations that were truly extraordinary (Matt 14:28–31). Space does not allow to speak of the special attention and the private tuition that Peter received occasionally from Jesus himself (Matt 16:22–23; 17:24–27; 21–22).  </para>
      <para role="indent">But astonishingly, not even this sustained grooming by the Master Teacher himself will suffice to fully prepare Peter for the pastoral task. Once the actual work of shepherding got under way, further training became necessary! For instance, though Jesus had said that the sheep that Peter was commissioned to shepherd would include elements which were not part of the Jewish fold (John 10:1b; 17:20ff.), it will take the dramatic intervention of God himself to persuade him to reach out to the Gentile portion of the flock (Acts 10:13–16). And while that experience taught Peter that “God does not show favoritism” (Acts 10:34), it will take the stern rebuke of his junior colleague Paul to help him apply this principle consistently (Gal 2:11–15). </para>
      <para role="indent">Clearly, if Peter’s case teaches anything, it is that biblically speaking the task of caring for the people of God is not entrusted to anyone irrespective of whether or not they are prepared for it. Throughout the gospels Peter is portrayed as the leader of the Twelve (John 1:42, 21:15ff.; Luke 5:5ff.; Matt 14:25–31). This shows that he had some leadership qualities prior to his training experience. But in the face of this concentrated focus on his training history, it is reasonable to conclude that his natural abilities were not considered adequate for the pastoral role he was called to play. To serve him well for that demanding task, they had to be developed, honed, sharpened, and supplemented. </para>
